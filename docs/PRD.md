# DIGIPINner - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Overview
DIGIPINner is an interactive web application that allows users to work with DIGIPINs (Digital PINs) for locations in India. The application provides a map interface where users can view PIN code boundaries, drop pins to generate DIGIPINs, and look up locations using DIGIPINs.

## 2. Objectives
- Provide an interactive map of India with zoom and pan capabilities
- Enable DIGIPIN generation from map coordinates
- Allow DIGIPIN lookup to locate positions on the map
- Display PIN code boundaries for reference

## 3. User Stories

### 3.1 Map Interaction
- As a user, I want to view a map of India that I can zoom and pan
- As a user, I want to see PIN code boundaries overlaid on the map

### 3.2 DIGIPIN Generation
- As a user, I want to drop a pin on the map
- As a user, I want to see the DIGIPIN generated for the dropped pin's location
- As a user, I want to copy the generated DIGIPIN to clipboard

### 3.3 DIGIPIN Lookup
- As a user, I want to enter a DIGIPIN
- As a user, I want the map to zoom to the location corresponding to the entered DIGIPIN
- As a user, I want to see a marker at the DIGIPIN location

## 4. Technical Requirements

### 4.1 Map Component
- Use a mapping library (e.g., Leaflet, Mapbox) for interactive maps
- Support zoom levels appropriate for both country-level and street-level views
- Implement smooth panning and zooming animations

### 4.2 DIGIPIN Implementation
- Implement the DIGIPIN algorithm as per the India Post specification
- Support both encoding (location to DIGIPIN) and decoding (DIGIPIN to location)
- Handle edge cases (e.g., invalid DIGIPINs, locations outside India)

### 4.3 Data
- Integrate with the India PIN Code GeoJSON data
- Implement efficient loading and rendering of PIN code boundaries
- Cache data where appropriate for performance

### 4.4 User Interface
- Clean, responsive design that works on desktop and tablet devices
- Clear visual feedback for user actions
- Intuitive controls for pin placement and DIGIPIN entry

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Performance
- Map should load within 3 seconds on a standard 4G connection
- PIN code boundaries should render without significant lag
- Smooth interactions even on lower-end devices

### 5.2 Accessibility
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility

### 5.3 Security
- No sensitive user data collection required
- Secure handling of any location data

- npm or yarn
- Mapbox GL JS (for interactive mapping)
- React (for UI components)

## 7. Success Metrics
- Time to first meaningful paint < 3s
- 95% successful DIGIPIN generation/lookup operations
- Average session duration > 2 minutes
- < 5% bounce rate

## 7. Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Mapbox GL JS
- **Build Tools**: Vite, npm/yarn
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: CSS Modules
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library

## 8. Future Enhancements
- Shareable links for specific locations/DIGIPINs
- Mobile app versions (iOS/Android)
- Additional map layers (e.g., landmarks, points of interest)
- Batch DIGIPIN generation/lookup
- Integration with other mapping services

## 9. Open Questions
- Are there any rate limits on the PIN Code GeoJSON API?
- What is the expected accuracy of DIGIPINs?
- Are there any specific browser compatibility requirements?
