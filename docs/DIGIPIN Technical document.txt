1. INTRODUCTION
The Department of Posts has undertaken an initiative to establish a Digital Public
Infrastructure (DPI) for a standardized, geo-coded addressing system in India. As a part of this
initiative, the Department is releasing final version of DIGIPIN – the foundation layer of the
DPI. This initiative seeks to provide simplified addressing solutions for seamless delivery of
public and private services and to enable “Address as a Service” (AaaS) across the country.
DIGIPIN is an open-source national level addressing grid developed by Department of Posts
in collaboration with IIT Hyderabad and NRSC, ISRO and is a key component of the digital
address ecosystem. The beta version of the technical document on DIGIPIN was placed for
public comments and expert opinion.
After thorough analysis of the comments received through various stakeholder consultations,
the Department has now finalized the DIGIPIN Grid that incorporates the relevant inputs. The
DIGIPIN layer will serve as a uniform address referencing framework available both offline
and online, enabling logical and precise location identification with directional attributes
across India, offering significant advantages of ensuring precise geographic identification and
thus complementing the conventional addressing system by providing an additional attribute.
This would bridge the gap between physical locations and their digital representation.
Incorporating DIGIPIN as an additional address attribute enables the leveraging of GIS
capabilities, laying the foundation for future GIS-based digitalization of service delivery across
various organizations in a cost-effective manner. The DIGIPIN would enhance location
accuracy across various sectors by providing precise geographic coordinates, ensuring
accurate service delivery and reducing emergency response times. By integrating DIGIPIN,
Banking Financial Services and Insurance sector can leverage the additional address attribute,
DIGIPIN, to enhance accuracy and efficiency in their KYC processes. DIGIPIN can simplify
address management thus enhancing citizen convenience.
A standardized geo-coded addressing system would enhance India’s geo-spatial ecosystem.
It would add to the geospatial knowledge stack of the country in line with the National
Geospatial Policy 2022, which seeks to strengthen the geospatial sector to support national
development, economic prosperity and a thriving information economy.
This document outlines the technical details of DIGIPIN, the National-Level Addressing Grid.

2. DESIGN APPROACH
2.1 Core Concept:
The DIGIPIN layer is the cornerstone of the entire digital address ecosystem.
DIGIPIN is visualised as an alpha numeric offline grid system that divides the geographical
territory of India into uniform 4-meter by 4-meter(approx.) units. Each of these 4m X 4m units
(approx.) is assigned a unique 10-digit alphanumeric code, derived from the latitude and
longitude coordinates of the unit. This alphanumeric code serves as the offline addressing
reference for any specific location within the DIGIPIN system. DIGIPIN is thus strictly a
function of the latitude and longitude of the location represented as a grid value. The system
is designed to be scalable, adaptable, and integrated with existing GIS applications.
2.2 DIGIPIN layer:
DIGIPIN layer will act as the addressing reference system which will be available offline and
can be used for locating addresses in a logical manner with directional properties built into it
due to the logical naming pattern followed in its construction. DIGIPIN Grid system being an
addressing referencing system, can be used as the base stack for development of other
ecosystems where addressing is one of the processes in the workflow. Since DIGIPIN solely
represents a location and does not store any personal information, it respects privacy.
3. DIGIPIN : Code Architecture
The detailed structure is such that the DIGIPIN is essentially an encoding of the latitude and
longitude of the address into a sequence of alphanumeric symbols using the following 16
symbols: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, C, J, K, L, M, P, F, T.
The process of identifying the cells is done in a hierarchical fashion. The encoding is performed
at various levels, and the basic idea is the following:
 A bounding box is used that covers the entire country.
 The bounding box is split into 16 (i.e., 4x4) regions. Each region is labeled by one of
symbols 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, C, F, J, K, L, M, P, T. The first character in the code would
identify one of these regions. This is called the level-1 partition.
4
 Each region is then subdivided into 16 subregions in a similar fashion. Each of the 16
subregions are labeled by the 16 characters. For a given region, the subregion is
identified by the second character of the code. Therefore, the first two characters of
the code uniquely identify one of the 16^2=256 subregions. This is called the level-2
partition.
 The encoding of successive characters, and therefore the next 8 levels is done in an
identical fashion. The 10-symbol code therefore uniquely identifies one of the 16^10
cells within the bounding box.
3.1 Bounding box:
Following are the details of the bounding box used:
Figure 1: DIGIPIN level-1 grid lines (yellow) overlaid over the Indian region showing the
extent of DIGIPIN bounding box
 Longitude 63.5 – 99.5 degrees east
 Latitude 2.5 – 38.5 degrees north
 The Coordinate Reference System (CRS) used in the proposed code design is
EPSG:4326. Using EPSG:4326 (WGS84 datum at epoch 2005) has several advantages
like wide recognition and adoption, simplicity and global coverage.
The choice of the corner points of the bounding box are based on the following
considerations:
 This includes the entire territory of India.
5
 Since the proposed extent has latitudinal and longitudinal extent of 36°, the final grid
size after 10th iteration is a perfect square and has smaller size of 3.8m x 3.8m.
 This bounding box ensures alignment of DIGIPIN level-1 grid lines with Survey of
India’s 0.25° x 0.25° toposheets (topographical sheet numbering system), which are
used for mapping at 1:50K scale
 Includes the maritime Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and therefore DIGIPIN allows to
provide addresses to Indian assets in the sea (oil rigs, future man-made islands, etc.),
or even potentially be used to locate regions in the sea by the maritime sector. The
maritime EEZ is computed assuming 200 nautical miles extent from the coastline.
 Level-1 grid lines do not cut through cities with very large population
 The level-10 cells would be almost rectangular, but the dimensions would vary based
on the latitude. This would translate to a cell of size smaller than 3.8-meter x 3.8-meter
if measured at the equator, and this is reasonable given the accuracy of most current
commercially available Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS).
3.2 Properties of DIGIPIN
 DIGIPIN contains the geographic location of the area. It is possible to extract the latitude
and longitude of the address from the DIGIPIN with low complexity.
 DIGIPIN has been designed for the Indian context. All points of interest to India (including
maritime regions) can be assigned codes, and it is possible to assign code even in areas
that are very densely populated.
 The format of the DIGIPIN is intuitive and human-readable. Effort was made to infuse a
sense of directionality within the format of DIGIPIN.
 DIGIPIN is independent of the land use pattern and the structure built. Note that DIGIPIN
is designed as a permanent digital infrastructure, that does not change with changes in
the names of state, city or locality, or with changes in the road network in an area. The
DIGIPIN is designed to be robust to accommodate future developments and changes. The
arrival of a new building in a community, or even a new village or city in a district, or
changes in the name of a road or locality will not affect the underlying DIGIPIN.
 The length of the DIGIPIN is designed to be as small as possible in order to provide an
efficient digital representation of addresses.

3.3 Labelling of regions at various levels
Figure 2: Labelling of DIGIPIN level-1 grids (left) and 4x4 grid used for labelling (right)
 In first iteration (level-1), the bounding box is divided into 16 regions using a 4x4 grid
and each region is labelled using 16 symbols, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, C, F, J, K, L, M, P, and
T, as shown in Figure 2.
 A consistent gridding and labelling scheme is applied across all subsequent iterations
(Levels 2 to 10). For these levels, the same labelled grid is utilized, with the labelling
process carried out in a hierarchical manner.
 Each Level-1 region is further split into 16 sub-regions called Level-2 regions as
illustrated in the Figure 3. The regions are hierarchically partitioned into sub-regions
in an identical fashion.
 Symbols are assigned in anticlockwise fashion, spiraling outwards. The grid provides
some sense of directionality and adjacency cells labeled by consecutive symbols (such
as 6 and 7) are geographical neighbors.

3.4 Assigning DIGIPIN to coordinates coinciding with DIGIPIN Grid Lines
In some of the cases, coordinates of a location may coincide with DIGIPIN grid lines. In such
scenario, the location is assigned a DIGIPIN symbol of the adjoining right-side (eastward) grid,
if it falls on a vertical (north-south) grid line. Similarly, a DIGIPIN symbol of adjoining up- side
(northward) grid is assigned, if location coincides with a horizontal (east-west) grid line. The
coordinates coinciding with DIGIPIN line intersection are assigned to adjoining top-right grid.
The exception is made to coordinates coinciding with top-most (38.5° N) and right-most (99.5°
E) grid lines wherein DIGIPIN symbols of the adjoining bottom-side (southward) grid and left-
side (westward) grids are assigned, respectively.
3.5 Grid sizes at various levels
As explained above, the DIGIPIN generation is an iterative procedure. At level-1, the bounding
box is divided into 16 (4x4) regions. The total latitudinal and longitudinal width of bounding
box is 36°, resulting in 9° x 9° regions at level-1. Similarly, at level-2, each 9° x 9° region is
further divided into 16 (4x4) sub-regions, resulting in 2.25° x 2.25° regions. The same process
is carried out up to 10 levels. The table below shows a relation between the DIGIPIN code
length, corresponding grid size and approximate linear distance at the equator. It gives an
estimate of the positional uncertainty associated with DIGIPIN code length. For instance, a
DIGIPIN code of length 6 represents a ~ 1km x 1km region. It requires an additional 4 digits to
precisely locate a 3.8m x 3.8m region inside this region.

4. Key differences between Beta version and Final Version of DIGIPIN
 A modification in the extent of the DIGIPIN bounding box from 63.5° - 99°E & 1.5°-
39°N to 63.5°- 99.5°E & 2.5°- 38.5°N)
 The replacement of characters G, W, and X with C, F and T to maintain the phonetic
and visual clarity of DIGIPIN, while maintaining the sequence of characters.
 A uniform gridding and labelling scheme across all iterations (1-10).
